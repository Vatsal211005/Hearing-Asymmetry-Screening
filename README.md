# Hearing-Asymmetry-Screening
A web-based hearing asymmetry screening tool built with Flask, JavaScript, and Chart.js. Tests hearing thresholds across frequencies (250–5000 Hz) using pure-tone audiometry, visualizes results in an audiogram, and detects ear asymmetry. Features user registration, headphone calibration, and result downloads. Demo only—not for medical diagnosis.
